# Why Stellar?

We chose Stellar for its advantages in building micro-interaction apps like StellarPlay:

1. **Low transaction fees** – ideal for small, frequent game actions  
2. **Fast confirmation** – supports real-time predictions and payouts  
3. **Soroban** – enables custom smart contracts for reward management  
4. **Launchtube** – seamless onboarding for new users  
5. **Passkey support** – secure, decentralized identity

Stellar provides a better alternative to Ethereum for lightweight, interactive consumer dApps.
